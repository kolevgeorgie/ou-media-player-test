# ou-media-player-test

Remote unit tests for OU Media Player at The Open University.

* <https://mediaplayer.open.ac.uk>

Note: this repository is an interim solution. Naturally, we want the tests in the same code-base as the Player.

## Requirements

* A recent [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), including `npm`.

## Install

1. In a terminal type `npm install -g mocha`
2. Clone the repo.
3. `npm install && mocha`
